# HabitSailor

## Intro

HabitSailor is a work-in-progress SailfishOS client for HabitRPG servers like Habitica.
It is meant to be imported int the QtCreator of the SailfishOS SDK.

HabitSailor is free software, released under GPLv3. Artwork is CC-BY-SA 3.0. (see LICENCE file for details)

## Why

Because the Android client is terribly slow and the website is too heavy for Jolla’s navigator.
Also I don’t like very much the Android emulation stack.

## Roadmap

Already working:

* Login/Logout
* Show basic profile info
* Display Habits, pressing on plus or minus
* Detects death, revive from profile page
* Refresh action from pulley menu

Most importantly and in approximate order:

* Display To-Dos and Tasks with their subtasks, be able to check and uncheck
* React gracefully when connection drops
* A useful cover

Some stuff that would be great in approximate order:

* Rewards (at least the life potion)
* Filter tasks by tag, completed/not completed
* Sort tasks by color
* Other rewards (at least custom rewards and spells)
* Tasks editing, creation, deletion
* Social (team, guilds)
