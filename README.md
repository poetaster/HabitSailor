# HabitSailor

## Intro

HabitSailor is a work-in-progress SailfishOS client for HabitRPG servers like Habitica.
It is meant to be imported int the QtCreator of the SailfishOS SDK.

## Why

Because the Android client is terribly slow and the website is too heavy for Jolla’s navigator.
Also I don’t like very much the Android emulation stack.

## Roadmap

Already working:

* Login/Logout
* Show basic profile info

Most importantly and in approximate order:

* Display habits list, be able to click on them
* Display To-Dos and Tasks with their subtasks, be able to check and uncheck
* React gracefully when connection drops, refresh
* A useful cover

Some stuff that would be great in approximate order:

* Rewards, Spells
* Tasks editing
* Social (team, guilds)
